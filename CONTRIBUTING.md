# CONTRIBUTING

## Requirements

A resource suggestion must meet the majority of the following requirements:

* The primary purpose of publication is to impart, communicate, or disseminate
  knowledge that which is relevant and fundamental to one or more of my areas
  of interests;

* The resource has re-read and referential value;

* The resource imparts, communicate, or disseminate knowledge that which, on
  the balance of probability, will not become outdated within the next five years;

* The knowledge and information with which the resource contains is fundamental
  to the intellectual advancement of a field or body of knowledge;

* The production of such resource is not a direct consequence or response to a
  contemporary event within the last 5 years;

* The dissemination of such resource is not carried out in pursuit of a
  political agenda, self-promotion, corporate goals, or financial gain;

* The resource attempts, insofar as interpreted by a reasonable person, to
  impart, communicate, and disseminate knowledge in an impartial and unbiased
  manner;

These are not fool-proof requirements, and failure to meet one of them does not
necessarily bar the resource from being listed. The following does NOT bar a
resource from being listed:

* The author/co-author's reputation has been negatively impacted by revelation
  of a scandal or impropriety unrelated to the content of the resource;
