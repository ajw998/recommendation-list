## Requirements

Before making a resource suggestion, they must meet a majority of the
following requirements:

* The primary purpose of publication is to impart, communicate, or disseminate
  knowledge that which is relevant and fundamental to one or more of my areas
  of interests.

* The resource has re-read and referential value.

* The resource imparts, communicate, or disseminate knowledge that which, on
  the balance of probability, will not become outdated within the next five years.

* The knowledge and information with which the resource contains is fundamental
  to the intellectual advancement of a field of knowledge.

* The production of such resource is not a direct consequence or response to a
  contemporary event within the last 5 years.

* The dissemination of such resource is not carried out in pursuit of a
  political agenda, self-promotion, corporate goals, or financial gain.

* The resource attempts, insofar as interpreted by a reasonable person, to
  impart, communicate, and disseminate knowledge in an impartial and unbiased
  manner.

These are not fool-proof requirements, and failure to meet one of them does not
necessarily bar the resource from being listed.
